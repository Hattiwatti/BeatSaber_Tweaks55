# BeatSaber_Tweaks55
A collection of tweaks which by themselves dont deserve their own mod

# Currently implemented tweaks

*Everything is off by default, you need to manually enable whatever you want in the Mod Settings page of Tweaks55*

### Add Static lights toggle back
Reverts the two seperate select boxes back to one simple toggle

### Make Basegame Song-Search Fulltext
Changes the Basegame song search to be fulltext, so when searching for 'the top' it will not find all songs which contain 'the' and 'top' but instead only songs that contain 'the top'

### Show walls in Zen mode
Enables walls in Zen mode

### Disable Health warning
Disables the health warning you get on every game start

### Disable Ingame Editor
Prevents the ingame map editor from opening when clicking its button

### Keep Game settings on Cancel
Some of the ingame settings can be changed without actually applying them (Clicking OK), primarily Saber and Roomadjust settings. Enabling this allows you to simply click Cancel after changing them and have the settings stay instead of reset

### Disable Menu Logo Buzz (<1.14)
Disables the soundeffect played when the Logo in the menu flickers

### Disable Wall Clash
Disables wall rumble and the accompanying particles when touching walls with your saber

### Disable Saberclash
Disables all effects / rumble from touching sabers together

### Disable Cut Particles
Disables the particles that spawn from cutting blocks

### Disable World Particles / Dust
Disables the world particles / dust floating around

### Disable Debris
Makes your game crash more often on purpose, especially if you are about to get a PB

### Disable Fake wall bloom
Disables the 'Fake' bloom that is applied to walls when you disable Post-Processing bloom in the game settings so you get true 'No Bloom' (Also resolves 'Broken' walls on Noodle maps). Disabling this might require a game restart to function correctly

### Custom cut rumble profile
